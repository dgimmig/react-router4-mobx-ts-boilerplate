# react-router4-mobx-ts-boilerplate
A boilerplate for apps based on React, React Router 4, Mobx 3, TypeScript 2 and sass.

Works fine. 

Bundling and hot reloading via Webpack 2. 

In prod, minification + tree shaking (for both app code and vendor chunk. 

run `npm install` and `npm start`, then go to localhost:3000 (DEV)
run `npm run build` then `http-server build`, then go to localhost:8080 (PROD)

Inspired by https://github.com/mhaagens/react-mobx-react-router4-boilerplate and https://github.com/cafreeman/generator-mobx-react

Todo: 
* add react-md
* add lazy-route
